# Athena-Hack-2022

## Description

Hey! We are Codecritters! :wave:<br>
Thanks for checking out the repo - have fun!

This contains a webdev project for [Showcode's Athena Hackathon 2022](https://www.showcode.io/athena-hack-2022/?utm_medium=bsocial) for which we took on the Hack theme 'Improving refugee access to work, skills and careers' by Beamery<br>
The website was designed to connect refugess with personal mentors and recruiters that they would be suited for based on their skillsets and their interests. As a website, it is easily accessible: many public libraries and now cafes allow for internet access and/or computer usage. 

### How it will work
The home of the website starts with a quiz; a few questions to get to know the individual and to ensure they are matched with the mentors and recruiters that are best suited to them. At the end of the short quiz, they are information of mentor and recruiter profiles suited to them along with their contact information with a handy in-browser call function so communication can be done right away.

### Our reasonings and vision
We believe that connecting people to real people is important and that everyone is an individual so people's needs are different. That's why we decided upon a quiz: to get to know the individual from their hobbies to their skills - who says that they can't be the same! Everyone has their advantages and they just need an opportunity to showcase that. With this website they are directed directly to recruited that will allow them to display their appropriate skills in hopes of them being able to earn a job and stability. Guided mentors are also valuable in that they are able help bring out the best in these individuals and communicate with them in a more relaxed manner, offer advice, help develop their skills and more importantly be there for someone.
